# More Tab Colors
More Tab Colors is a Firefox extension that allows you to change the color of the main tab area. You can customize the color by sliding on the color picker, giving your browsing a refreshing look to match its vibe. Or, you can select from other colors you've already picked to group together tabs however you'd like to easily search for related tabs.

## How to Use
After installation is complete, click the More Tab Colors extension icon in the Firefox toolbar (you can optionally pin it to your toolbar). 
Then, choose your desired color using the color wheel. 
Click on Apply & Save in order to apply the color to the tabs and window. 
If you've already picked a color for another tab, you could also select from recent colors to have it match another tab.
Click on Reset to revert back to default colors.
